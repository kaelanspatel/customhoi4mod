#events
kaelan.2.t:0 "The Sun Document"
kaelan.2.d:0 "Found in the Dark Spaces, the Sun Document is our manifesto. It is the Art of War, the Capital, and the Bible all in one. Hail the Sun Document! Hail the State! Hail General Director Kaelan Patel!"
kaelan.2.a:0 "Hail!"
kaelan.3.t:0 "Directive Number One"
kaelan.3.d:0 "Our first order of buisness in this world should be to create a strong industrial base. Though we have control over a vast majority of Italy and part of the Balkan coast, our industries are as of yet insufficient."
kaelan.3.a:0 "Begin Directive No. 1"
kaelan.4.t:0 "Operation Moon"
kaelan.4.d:0 "As it is detailed in part of the Sun Document, the Directorate of Esoterics has begun research into alternate realities, some of which naturally bear some great resemblance to our own. We could use this to grant superatural insight into all things."
kaelan.4.a:0 "We See You"
kaelan.5.t:0 "Otherworld Technologies"
kaelan.5.d:0 "Some of these strange earths are filled with odd and fantastic technologies. Reverse engineering them has yielded several interesting advances..."
kaelan.5.a:0 "Operation Moon bears fruit!"
kaelan.6.t:0 "Operation Rigel" 
kaelan.6.d:0 "With our xenotechnology research efforts in full swing, we have come across the notion of space travel in several alternate universes. Clearly we must be the first to cash in on this wonderful idea. The very stars will serve the the Authority!"
kaelan.6.a:0 "Ad Astra!"
kaelan.7.t:0 "Operation Black Sun"
kaelan.7.d:0 "It is almost troubling to see how many alternate realities we have come across that have been devastated by a certain type of weapon. Our scientists have coined this weapon the Black Sun. We must have it."
kaelan.7.a:0 "Hopefully the secret to this weapon will be ours alone..."
kaelan.8.t:0 "Dealing with the Xenos Subhumans"
kaelan.8.d:0 "During our interdimensional exploits, we have come across many entities. Some are human, others decidedly... less so. Many of these so-called xenos are primitive and dull. Surely there can be no greater task for them than the Great Communal Task! Their lives will be much improved in our workshops and fields, and on the revolutionary fronts, of course!"
kaelan.8.a:0 "They will build til they break!"
kaelan.8.b:0 "They will serve, humanoid or no!"
kaelan.8.c:0 "All humanoid ones will serve; the others can go to Gregistan for all I care!"
kaelan.9.t:0 "Alternate Timeline Colonialism"
kaelan.9.d:0 "Using several local trans-brane tunneling initatives, we have been able to punch holes through to alternate timelines where subhuman xenos have populated a resource-rich alternate earth. After subjugating them, these areas are free for the taking." 
kaelan.9.a:0 "Behold the State"
kaelan.10.t:0 "KGAS Khonshu"
kaelan.10.d:0 "Using the dark science uncovered from our xenotech research, we have successfully landed a... volunteer on the moon! Her sacrifice will never be forgotten."
kaelan.10.a:0 "We'll give full posthumous honors, and a nice statue."
kaelan.11.t:0 "Nuclear Energy"
kaelan.11.d:0 "Our research into the Black Sun device has clarified the enigma of nuclear energy for us. Fission is powerful, but fusion is another thing altogether. We have designed a reactor based off of a reverse-engineered xenos war machine. The future is, shall we say, looking bright!"
kaelan.11.a:0 "Five years off indeed!"
kaelan.12.t:0 "KGAS Ares"
kaelan.12.d:0 "First the moon, now mars! Our expiditionary force has successfully established a base camp. We plan to deploy mining materiel in the next month."
kaelan.12.a:0 "We Hunger"
kaelan.13.t:0 "Communion"
kaelan.13.d:0 "There are things out there which writhe beneath the fabric of the world. Let's talk to them; perhaps they'll be just like us underneath those exoskeletons!"
kaelan.13.a:0 "We come in peace... at this specific moment."
kaelan.14.t:0 "A State of Shadows"
kaelan.14.d:0 "We can't neglect technological progress. The tethers of gravity, the light of the stars, the electromagnetism of the earth are all sciences, and thus can be controlled. Of course, we'll require significant resources to do this, but that is the sacrifice that must be made for progress."
kaelan.14.a:0 "To See With Eyes Unclouded"
